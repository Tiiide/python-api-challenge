Homework for Module 6 - Python API

In this module, we utilized the OpenWeatherAPI to query weather data for a random list of cities and plotted the data on scatter plots with regression lines.

We also utilized the GeoapifyAPI to query nearby hotel information for a set of cities and mapped it to hvplots showing the geographic location.
